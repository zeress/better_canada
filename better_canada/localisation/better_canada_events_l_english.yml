 better_canada.1.t:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef] Demands Alaska"
 better_canada.1.d:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef] has demanded that we immediately cede Alaska to them. They cite that it is an affront to have a foreign military so deep within their lands, being a direct insult to their sovereignty."
 better_canada.2.t:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef] considers us an ally and a friend"
 better_canada.2.d:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef] will be founding their own faction it seems and is already in talks of inviting us potentially. While not formally inviting us yet, they are giving us a courtesy notice to consider the possibility of a future together." 
 better_canada.2.a:0 "We'll consider it"
 better_canada.3.t:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef] founds the 'North American League'"
 better_canada.3.d:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef], having grown tired of the politics of Europe, has founded the 'North American League'. Their goals are officially stated as maintaining the status quo on their continent, but not everyone fully trusts this statement. There are even rumours that [USA.GetNameDef] may even be considering joining this faction."
 better_canada.3.a:0 "Interesting"
 better_canada.3.b:0 "Greatness Awaits"
 better_canada.4.t:0 "A Plebiscite is Held"
 better_canada.4.d:0 "The results are in. Every territory and province, except Quebéc, votes in large majority for the expansion of conscription rules. The troublesome aspect is that not only did Quebéc vote no, they voted nearly 73% against it. It is very likely that things will not change in Quebec in terms of conscription. Perhaps in light of what their peers have said they will change their minds, even if just a little. Of course we could be more forceful instead."
 better_canada.4.a:0 "What a bother..."
 better_canada.5.t:0 "Newfoundland defies [ENG.GetNameDef]"
 better_canada.5.d:0 "It would seem that the local garrisons of Newfoundland were extremely shocked at [ENG.GetNameDef] refusing the results of the referendum of the locals. When an angry mob approached the bases instead of fighting they instead were told to stand down by local officers, citing that it should be the will of the people to decide their own fate. As a result the garrisons were allowed to leave safely and forthright Newfoundland and Labrador belong to us."
 better_canada.5.a:0 "Just as planned"
 better_canada.6.d:0 "Earlier this morning locals of Newfoundland and Labrador were incited to a mob and marched onto the various garrison bases demanding their independence from [ENG.GetName]. The officers, fearing a senseless bloodshed, gave in to their demands and the [ENG.GetNameDef] troops were allowed to leave peacefully. There are already whispers that this was far too coordinated to have simply have been a 'random' set of mobs and accusations have been already levied towards [CAN.GetName] as being the likely culprit."
 better_canada.7.t:0 "Adrien Arcand unites the Fascists"
 better_canada.7.d:0 "Earlier today the various fascist parties of Canada held a national convention in Kingston, Ontario. There it was decided to unite all of the parties into one new party led by a particularily charismatic person called 'Adrien Arcand'. As his first action of this newly unified party Arcand held a rally at Massey Hall to promote the party. Referring himself as the 'Canadian führer' it seems he seeks to emulate the Nazi party."

 better_canada.20.d:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef] has demanded that we immediately cede Newfoundland and Labrador to them. They cite that it is an affront to have a foreign military so deep within their lands, being a direct insult to their sovereignty."

 better_canada.20.a:0 "Very Well"
 better_canada.20.b:0 "Absolutely Not!"
 better_canada.21.t:0 "Consider the options"
 better_canada.21.d:0 "Before doing anything we must decide how we approach this. We could just outright demand the land in question however there is a probably better route. The people of Labrador would most likely vote in our favor in a referendum making it much more likely for them to accept. Of course, they can still deny afterwards but it would give our cause much more credence if they were to do so."
 better_canada.21.a:0 "Hold the referendum"
 better_canada.21.b:0 "We need no referendum"
 better_canada.22.t:0 "The Newfoundland Referendum"
 better_canada.22.d:0 "It would seem that [CAN.GetNameDef] has encouraged the population of Newfoundland and Labrador to hold a referendum. They have overwhelmingly agreed that they would like to join Canada as one nation rather than stay under our rule. We could of course deny them this but it would give reason for a war if we do."
 better_canada.22.a:0 "We mustn't deny their will"
 better_canada.22.b:0 "Now is not the time for this"
 better_canada.23.t:0 "The Newfoundland Referendum"
 better_canada.23.d:0 "Earlier today the people of Newfoundland held a referendum and overwhelmingly agreed on requesting [ENG.GetNameDef] to release them to join Canada. [ENG.GetLeader] accepted the referendum as legal and gave the returned the land to [CAN.GetNameDef], including the debt the province already had to begin with."
 better_canada.23.a:0 "Interesting"
 better_canada.23.b:0 "Excellent"
 better_canada.23.c:0 "I hope this wasn't a mistake"
 better_canada.23.f:0 "Great News!"
 better_canada.24.t:0 "The Newfoundland Referendum"
 better_canada.24.d:0 "Earlier today the people of Newfoundland held a referendum and overwhelmingly agreed on requesting [ENG.GetNameDef] to release them to join Canada. [ENG.GetLeader] refused this referendum citing that they never approved of holding such a referendum in the first place and citing it as illegal. [CAN.GetLeader] is outraged by this news and vows to liberate the lands."
 better_canada.24.a:0 "Interesting"
 better_canada.24.b:0 "If it's war they  want..."
 better_canada.24.c:0 "The land is too valuable"
 better_canada.24.f:0 "We must prepare for the worst"
 better_canada.25.t:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef] Demands St. Pierre & Miquelon"
 better_canada.25.d:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef] has demanded that we immediately cede the islands of St. Pierre & Miquelon to them. They cite that it is an affront to have a foreign island so close to their lands, being a direct insult to their sovereignty."

 better_canada.30.d:0 "Earlier today [CAN.GetNameDef] demanded [USA.GetNameDef] cede Alaska to them, citing an unfair military presence as a direct insult to their sovereignty. In a surprising turn of events [USA.GetLeader] agreed and allowed the Canadians to take the state peacefully."
 better_canada.30.a:0 "I see"
 better_canada.30.b:0 "Excellent"
 better_canada.30.c:0 "Perhaps a mistake..."
 better_canada.30.f:0 "Excellent"
 better_canada.31.d:0 "Earlier today [CAN.GetNameDef] demanded [USA.GetNameDef] cede Alaska to them, citing an unfair military presence as a direct insult to their sovereignty. In an unsurprising turn of events [USA.GetLeader] strongly disagreed citing that Alaska was fairly sold to them by Russia and that they'll never give it up for free."
 better_canada.31.a:0 "I see"
 better_canada.31.b:0 "Damn"
 better_canada.31.c:0 "What were they thinking?"

 better_canada.41.t:0 "[CAN.GetNameDef] Demands Newfoundland and Labrador"
 better_canada.43.t:0 "They were convinced"
 better_canada.43.d:0 "The population was moved to reluctantly agree to some measure of conscription. While still lower than other provinces this should give us much more room to breathe now."
 better_canada.43.a:0 "This will help"
 better_canada.44.t:0 "They remain unconvinced"
 better_canada.44.d:0 "Your pleas fell on deaf ears. They cite having no interest in participating in the war machine of the Anglophones."

 better_canada.46.t:0 "Strict Conscription Enforcement Angers Them"
 better_canada.46.d:0 "You have moved the population to action with strict enforcement. This has severly upset the population and they are more than ever refusing to help."
 better_canada.46.a:0 "This could be bad..."  
 better_canada.47.d:0 "It would seem your demands on the Québecois eventually turned into a seperatist notion. They have cut all access to the province and are declaring themselves an independent nation."
 better_canada.47.a:0 "This is bad..."
 better_canada.48.t:0 "[QUE.GetName] secedes from [CAN.GetNameDef]"
 better_canada.48.d:0 "In an attempt to enforce conscription upon the local French populace in [CAN.GetNameDef] [CAN.GetLeader] seems to have only enraged the population in Québec instead. They have seceded from [CAN.GetNameDef] effective immediately. [CAN.GetLeader] has already called for action against this illegal move by [QUE.GetLeader]."
 better_canada.48.a:0 "Interesting"
 better_canada.48.b:0 "Only military action will help now"

 better_canada.50.t:0 "Massive Oil Discovery in [CAN.GetNameDef]"
 better_canada.50.d:0 "Imperial Oil Ltd had spent years leading up to and during the war drilling unsuccessfully for oil. Their luck changed however earlier today. By drilling deeper than they ever had before they made one final attempt to get lucky and finally succeeded. Already this is proving to be a massive economic boon for the province of Alberta."
 better_canada.50.a:0 "Interesting"
 better_canada.50.b:0 "Help it already has"
 better_canada.50.c:0 "Fantastic News!"
 better_canada.51.t:0 "Tungsten Discovery in Northwestern Canada"
 better_canada.51.d:0 "Prior to the war the exploration and development of tungsten mines was a very limited affair, generally done as a side effect of other things. More recently however we had expanded and promoted endeavours to find the rare metal in British Columbia and surrounding areas as they've always had some amounts of Tungsten. Today we finally had some success and found a fairly large reserve of it in 'Red Rose'; far in the north-west of the country."
 better_canada.51.a:0 "This will certainly help the war"
 better_canada.52.t:0 "Artificial Rubber Made in Sarnia, Ontario"
 better_canada.52.d:0 "Up until now we have heavily relied on natural rubber imported from south-east Asia. With the the nature of war however we cannot rely on that source anymore as we it may get cut-off by convoy raids. As a result Polymer Corp. had been looking into possible alternatives and finally had a breakthrough. They found the means to make something they call 'synthetic rubber'. Already it is being made in Sarnia but we should promote this research further and expand the industry."
 better_canada.52.a:0 "Excellent"
 better_canada.53.t:0 "The Question of Governance"
 better_canada.53.d:0 "Now that we've broken free we must re-organize our government. We could keep the nationalist momentum going and embrace Fascism, or we could let the people decide what to do moving forward."

 better_canada.53.b:0 "Let the people decide"
 better_canada.54.t:0 "Quebec comes to our Aid"
 better_canada.54.d:0 "We have great news, it would seem the Quebecois are finally willing to fully support the war effort. Perhaps they were swayed by our previous, more diplomatic requests for help?"
 better_canada.54.a:0 "Fantastic!"
